25	is	
26	a	
27	spirited	
28	narrative	
29	of	
30	the	
31	nastiest	
32	of	
33	these	
34	hearings	
35	,	
36	done	
37	with	
38	journalistic	
39	verve	
40	,	
41	but	
42	with	
43	a	
44	flawed	
45	legal	
46	philosophy	
47	.	

1	While	
2	the	
3	book	
4	amply	
5	justifies	
6	its	
7	subtitle	
8	,	
9	the	
10	title	
11	itself	
12	is	
13	dubious	
14	.	

1	What	
2	shook	
3	America	
4	was	
5	not	
6	a	
7	battle	
8	for	
9	justice	
10	but	
11	for	
12	naked	
13	power	
14	,	
15	in	
16	which	
17	an	
18	army	
19	of	
20	judicial	
21	activists	
22	rolled	
23	over	
24	a	
25	judge	
26	they	
27	had	
28	demonized	
29	.	

1	In	
2	its	
3	basic	
4	structure	
5	and	
6	style	
7	the	
8	book	
9	is	
10	novelistic	
11	,	
12	with	
13	piquant	
14	character	
15	portrayal	
16	,	
17	hard-wire	
18	action	
19	and	
20	devious	
21	intrigue	
22	of	
23	the	
24	sort	
25	more	
26	likely	
27	to	
28	be	
29	encountered	
30	in

27	,	
28	it	
29	was	
30	pretty	
31	clear	
32	that

35	never	
36	stood	
37	much	
38	chance	
39	of

1	As	
2	Mr.

7	the	
8	smell	
9	of

14	was	
15	in

8	's	
9	attackers	
10	come	
11	through	
12	more	
13	vividly	
14	than	
15	his

17	.	

1	Ralph

8	whipping	
9	a

11	of

13	groups	
14	into	
15	an

17	attacking

1	The	
2	upshot	
3	?	

1	Mr.	
2	Bork	
3	's	
4	opponents	
5	chose	
6	the	
7	battlefield	
8	,	
9	held	
10	it	
11	and	
12	kept	
13	it	
14	.	

1	Yet	
2	with	
3	the	
4	smooth	
5	confirmation	
6	of	
7	Anthony	
8	Kennedy

10	an	
11	``

15	only	
16	slightly

23	Mr.

1	Another	
2	upshot	
3	,	
4	however	
5	,	
6	was	
7	the	
8	chilling	
9	message

11	Bork	
12	hearings	
13	sent	
14	into

19	which	
20	the	
21	Supreme	
22	Court	
23	draws	
24	its	
25	talent	
26	.	

1	The

9	that

1	Unfortunately	
2	,	
3	the

2	more	
3	deeply	
4	into	
5	the	
6	doctrine	
7	of	
8	``	
9	judicial	
10	restraint	
11	,	
12	''	
13	he	
14	would	
15	have	
16	found	
17	a	
18	long	
19	history	
20	going	
21	back	
22	to	
23	the	
24	great	
25	decisions	
26	of	
27	Justice	
28	Holmes	
29	.	

1	He	
2	would	
3	discover	
4	it	
5	also	
6	in	
7	Alexander	
8	Bickel	
9	,	
10	a	
11	subtle	
12	constitutional	
13	scholar	
14	,	
15	Mr.	
16	Bork	
17	's	
18	closest	
19	friend	
20	at	
21	Yale	
22	,	
23	whose	
24	influence	
25	on	
26	the	
27	judge	
28	goes	
29	well	
30	beyond	
31	Mr.	
32	Bronner	
33	's	
34	reporting	
35	.	

1	Still	
2	,	
3	the	
4	long	
5	view	
6	of	
7	Robert	
8	Bork	
9	as	
10	constitutional	
11	thinker	
12	must	
13	be	
14	a	
15	spotty	
16	one	
17	.	

1	His	
2	strength	
3	lies	
4	in	
5	his	
6	majoritarian	
7	doctrine	
8	,	
9	which	
10	keeps	
11	the	
12	Court	
13	clear	
14	of	
15	transient	
16	group	
17	pressures	
18	and	
19	leaves	
20	most	
21	decisions	
22	in	
23	a	
24	democracy	
25	to	
26	elected	
27	legislatures	
28	and	
29	executives	
30	.	

1	Unfortunately	
2	,	
3	Mr.	
4	Bork	
5	failed	
6	to	
7	distinguish	
8	between	
9	such	
10	pressures	
11	and	
12	the	
13	emergence	
14	of	
15	great	
16	issues	
17	critical	
18	to	
19	a	
20	society	
21	that	
22	must	
23	be	
24	settled	
25	judicially	
26	if	
27	it	
28	is	
29	to	
30	cohere	
31	.	

1	The	
2	question	
3	of	
4	segregated	
5	schools	
6	,	
7	in	
8	Brown	
9	vs.	
10	Board	
11	of	
12	Education	
13	,	
14	was	
15	such	
16	an	
17	issue	
18	.	

1	In	
2	our	
3	time	
4	abortion	
5	has	
6	become	
7	another	
8	,	
9	best	
10	left	
11	to	
12	a	
13	line	
14	of	
15	Supreme	
16	Court	
17	decisions	
18	rather	
19	than	
20	to	
21	the	
22	chaos	
23	of	
24	50	
25	state	
26	legislatures	
27	.	

1	A	
2	reflective	
3	and	
4	growing	
5	consensus	
6	of	
7	Americans	
8	clearly	
9	wishes	
10	to	
11	apply	
12	the	
13	right	
14	to	
15	privacy	
16	in	
17	contraceptive	
18	matters	
19	(	
20	decided	
21	in	
22	the	
23	Griswold	
24	case	
25	)	
26	to	
27	abortion	
28	as	
29	well	
30	.	

1	One	
2	can	
3	understand	
4	Mr.	
5	Bork	
6	's	
7	fear	
8	that	
9	the	
10	new	
11	right	
12	to	
13	privacy	
14	will	
15	become	
16	intolerably	
17	stretched	
18	,	
19	though	
20	a	
21	Supreme	
22	Court	
23	composed	
24	of	
25	men	
26	and	
27	women	
28	with	
29	realism	
30	,	
31	guts	
32	and	
33	a	
34	sense	
35	of	
36	limits	
37	should	
38	be	
39	able	
40	to	
41	manage	
42	it	
43	.	

1	What	
2	is	
3	certain	
4	is	
5	that	
6	if	
7	Americans	
8	allow	
9	another	
10	happening

1	Mr.	
2	Krenz	
3	,

5	52	
6	,	
7	is	
8	known	
9	as	
10	an	
11	old-guard	
12	ironfist	
13	,	
14	one	
15	likely	
16	to	
17	continue	
18	the	
19	method	
20	of	
21	running	
22	a	
23	country	
24	that	
25	the	
26	Berlin	
27	Wall	
28	made	
29	famous	
30	.	

1	Even	
2	if

4	were	
5	to	
6	change	
7	his	
8	stripes

11	another	
12	Milton	
13	Friedman

15	however	
16	,	
17	he	
18	would

23	chance

2	Krenz	
3	almost

6	be	
7	a

9	version	
10	of	
11	Erich	
12	Honecker	
13	,	
14	his	
15	rigid	
16	predecessor	
17	as	
18	dictator	
19	.	

1	Mr.	
2	Krenz	
3	has	
4	followed	
5	much	
6	the	
7	same	
8	career	
9	path	
10	as	
11	Mr.	
12	Honecker	
13	:	
14	Both	
15	spent	
16	years	
17	overseeing	
18	the	
19	Freie	
20	Deutsche	
21	Jugend	
22	,	
23	the	
24	youth	
25	group	
26	that	
27	is	
28	the	
29	communist	
30	regime	
31	's	
32	principal	
33	tool	
34	for	
35	stamping	
36	young	
37	Germans	
38	into	
39	socialist	
40	citizens	
41	.	

1	More	
2	recently	
3	,	
4	Mr.	
5	Krenz	
6	has	
7	been	
8	in

11	East	
12	German	
13	security	
14	,	
15	and	
16	is	
17	the	
18	youngest	
19	member	
20	of	
21	the	
22	ruling	
23	Politburo	
24	.	

1	Faced	
2	with

5	Honecker	
6	,	
7	so	
8	many	
9	despairing	
10	East	
11	Germans	
12	are	
13	likely	
14	to	
15	flee	
16	that	
17	the	
18	two	
19	German	
20	peoples

2	if

4	Germany	
5	's	
6	arthritic	
7	Politburo	
8	does	
9	loosen	
10	up

16	to	
17	make	
18	serious	
19	efforts	
20	at	
21	reform	
22	,	
23	he	
24	will	
25	face	
26	a

28	just

1	For

14	,	
15	commonly

1	It

1	But	
2	while

1	For

15	100	
16	.	

1	As	
2	a	
3	result	
4	,	
5	the	
6	OEX	
7	insurance	
8	may	
9	or

25	.	

1	In	
2	addition	
3	,	
4	OEX	
5	options

1	Shortly

1	Key

6	that	
7	the

1	For

8	something	
9	of	
10	a

1	In

11	the

13	for	
14	their	
15	support	
16	,	
17	into	
18	attacking	
19	Jalalabad	
20	.	

1	They

3	more	
4	than	
5	25	
6	%	
7	casualties	
8	;	
9	journalists

12	they	
13	faced	
14	minefields	
15	without	
16	mine	
17	detectors	
18	.	

1	The	
2	wonder	
3	is	
4	not	
5	that	
6	the	
7	resistance	
8	has	
9	failed	
10	to	
11	topple	
12	the	
13	Kabul	
14	regime	
15	,	
16	but	
17	that	
18	it	
19	continues	
20	to	
21	exist	
22	and	
23	fight	
24	at	
25	all	
26	.	

1	Last	
2	summer	
3	,	
4	in	
5	response	
6	to	
7	congressional	
8	criticism	
9	,	
10	the	
11	State	
12	Department	
13	and	
14	the	
15	CIA	
16	said	
17	they	
18	had	
19	resumed	
20	military	
21	aid	
22	to	
23	the	
24	resistance	
25	months	
26	after	
27	it	
28	was	
29	cut	
30	off	
31	;	
32	but	
33	it	
34	is	
35	not	
36	clear	
37	how	
38	much	
39	is	
40	being	
41	sent	
42	or	
43	when	
44	it	
45	will	
46	arrive	
47	.	

1	For	
2	months	
3	the	
4	resistance	
5	has	
6	been	
7	defenseless	
8	against	
9	air	
10	attack	
11	.	

1	Thus	
2	far	
3	there	
4	is	
5	no	
6	indication	
7	that	
8	they	
9	have	
10	been	
11	re-supplied	
12	with	
13	Stingers	
14	or

3	U.S.

6	indicated

10	that	
11	the

16	on	
17	what

1	The

1	In

19	,	
20	which	
21	found	
22	that

24	depended

27	the

30	breached

32	fiduciary	
33	duty	
34	to

14	Mr.	
15	Chestman	
16	,

1	Basically	
2	,	
3	Mr.	
4	Chestman	
5	was	
6	a

1	It

1	Arguably

9	there

17	Before

7	with

10	Richard

1	But	
2	while	
3	making	
4	the	
5	obvious	
6	point	
7	that	
8	both

10	develop	
11	variations	
12	from	
13	themes	
14	,	
15	this

21	nature	
22	of	
23	Mr.	
24	Glass	
25	's

27	.	

1	Its

3	austere

1	The	
2	magazine	
3	had	
4	its	
5	best	
6	year	
7	yet	
8	in	
9	1988	
10	,	
11	when	
12	it

1	But	
2	this	
3	year	
4	,	
5	when	
6	the	
7	hullabaloo	
8	surrounding	
9	its	
10	centennial	
11	died	
12	,	
13	so	
14	too	
15	did	
16	some	
17	advertiser	
18	interest	
19	.	

1	The	
2	reason	
3	,	
4	ad	
5	executives	
6	say	
7	,	
8	is	
9	that	
10	the	
11	entire

13	business	
14	has	
15	been	
16	soft	
17	--	
18	and	
19	National	
20	Geographic	
21	has	
22	some	
23	quirks	
24	that	
25	make	
26	it	
27	especially	
28	unattractive	
29	during	
30	a	
31	soft	
32	market	
33	.	

1	Perhaps	
2	the	
3	biggest	
4	of	
5	those	
6	factors	
7	is	
8	its	
9	high	
10	ad	
11	prices	
12	--	
13	$	
14	130,000	
15	for	
16	a	
17	four-color	
18	page	
19	,	
20	vs.	
21	$	
22	47,000	
23	for	
24	the	
25	Smithsonian	
26	,	
27	a	
28	comparable	
29	publication	
30	with	
31	a	
32	far	
33	smaller

1	When	
2	ad	
3	dollars	
4	are	
5	tight	
6	,	
7	the	
8	high	
9	page	
10	cost	
11	is	
12	a	
13	major	
14	deterrent	
15	for	
16	advertisers	
17	,	
18	who	
19	generally	
20	want	
21	to	
22	appear	
23	regularly	
24	in	
25	a	
26	publication	
27	or	
28	not

43	.	

1	To	
2	combat	
3	that	
4	problem	
5	,	
6	National	
7	Geographic	
8	,	
9	like	
10	other	
11	magazines	
12	,	
13	began	
14	offering	
15	regional	
16	editions	
17	allowing	
18	advertisers	
19	to	
20	appear	
21	in	
22	only	
23	a

43	the	
44	largest	
45	25	
46	markets	
47	.	

1	But	
2	the	
3	magazine	
4	was	
5	slower	
6	than	
7	its	
8	competitors	
9	to	
10	come	
11	up	
12	with	
13	its	
14	regional	
15	editions	
16	,	
17	and

27	competitors	
28	.	

1	Time

1	Another	
2	sticking	
3	point	
4	for	
5	advertisers	
6	was	
7	National	
8	Geographic	
9	's	
10	tradition	
11	of	
12	lumping	
13	its	
14	ads	
15	together	
16	,	
17	usually	
18	at	
19	the	
20	beginning	
21	or	
22	end	
23	of	
24	the	
25	magazine	
26	,	
27	rather	
28	than	
29	spreading	
30	ads	
31	out	
32	among	
33	its	
34	articles	
35	,	
36	as	
37	most	
38	magazines	
39	do	
40	.	

1	And	
2	National	
3	Geographic	
4	's	
5	smaller-than-average	
6	size	
7	means	
8	extra	
9	production	
10	costs	
11	for	
12	advertisers	
13	.	

1	But	
2	Ms.	
3	McCraw	
4	says	
5	the

9	back

27	.	

1	And	
2	it	
3	just

1	When	
2	the

5	,	
6	President	
7	Carter	
8	was	
9	so	
10	scared	
11	that	
12	the	
13	shah	
14	's	
15	ghost	
16	would	
17	blame	
18	him	
19	for

1	But	
2	that	
3	ghost	
4	would	
5	n't	
6	settle	
7	for

10	he	
11	wanted	
12	money

14	people	
15	--

1	So	
2	Mr.

1	But	
2	that
